      <h2>WHAT ARE ESSENTIAL OILS?</h2>

        <p>
          Essential oils are concentrated extracts harvested from plants, herbs, and trees, which
          are carefully steam distilled or cold pressed. These pure, precious oils are more potent
          than the botanicals from which theyâ€™re extracted and contain powerful, concentrated health
          and wellness benefits.
